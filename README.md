Data Structures with C

- Hello there. I will publish my Data Structures with C notes in this folder.
- This folder contains the topics I learned from YouTube.
- We took this Data Structures with C course in the fall semester of the second year of university.

> Most of my Data Structures with C notes are from the YouTube courses but not exactly the same because I watched the video and then tried to do what I learned.
